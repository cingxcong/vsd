## Installation
  
Dependencies

- [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) (optional, *recommended*) only required for transmuxing and transcoding streams.
- [chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome) / [chromium](https://www.chromium.org/getting-involved/download-chromium/) (optional) only required for `capture` and `collect` subcommands. 

Visit [releases](https://github.com/clitic/vsd/releases) for prebuilt binaries or use [latest builds](https://nightly.link/clitic/vsd/workflows/build/main). Download and extract archive and then copy vsd binary to any path. Now add that path to your `PATH` environment variable.

## Alternatives

List of alternatives to vsd:

1. [N_m3u8DL-RE](https://github.com/nilaoda/N_m3u8DL-RE) is the best alternative to vsd. It also supports live playlist which vsd doesn't. It doesn't come with features like *capture*.
2. [N_m3u8DL-CLI](https://github.com/nilaoda/N_m3u8DL-CLI) is also good but it is not cross platform.
3. [m3u8-downloader](https://github.com/llychao/m3u8-downloader) is also good but it has very few customizable options.
4. [webvideo-downloader](https://github.com/jaysonlong/webvideo-downloader) opens up the website using chrome and then captures m3u8 requests. vsd's *capture* command is closest to this functionality.
5. [dash-mpd-cli](https://github.com/emarsden/dash-mpd-cli) is very good for downloading DASH playlists. Also, most of the vsd internals for parsing and downloading DASH playlists is taken for it's main project.
